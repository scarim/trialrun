NASA will get us there. 
But what will we eat?
CUBES may find a solution...
That is if Arthrospira really is the right organism to work with. 
I mean how many other microorganisms should we introduce to the lab?

Instead we may go to Venus. Less hospitable for us, but maybe more hospitable to our bacteria?
These thoughts are random.
